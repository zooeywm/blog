## About this website

The original intention of build this website is to record some notes and share some ideas. I hope you can find something useful here!

Having compared several [static site generators](./#other-static-site-generators), I finally chose Hugo. It is fast, easy to use and has a large number of themes. I also like the idea of static site, which is more secure and easy to maintain.

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go. The theme is [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/).

There is a demo website with source code in `PaperMod`'s [exampleSite](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite) branch, this website is modified based on it.

## Other static site generators

- [hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo)
- [mkdocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs)
- [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola): Note that zola is a new static site generator written in Rust, it is fast and easy to use, but it is not as mature as Hugo.
